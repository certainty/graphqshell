# GraphQShell

A textual GraphQL introspector that provides schema statistics and a way to navigate remote schemas. (At least it will at some point :D)

## State
You can savely consider this very WIP.
I've overhauled the UI layer based on ideas from the awesome golang [bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea).

## Prerequisites
You need to have stack and make installed.

## Building the project

Keep it simple and just run `make` to build the project.

```
nix-shell shell.nix
make
```

## This is what it currently looks like
